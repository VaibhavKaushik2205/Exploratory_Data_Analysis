RESULT:

The efficiency decreases after every call made. After the 7th call, we see that the efficiency decreases considerably. Hence we can reduce the marketing cost by not calling a person more than 7 times.
Hence, we can reduce the marketing price by 9.1% while still keeping a conversion percentage of 98.4% by limiting the no of calls made to a consumer to 7.
